Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-07-28
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Fixed 'Add another' button to validate and redirect correctly when 
  only one content type is used for the series vocabulary.
by greenSkin: Added series edit menu item '/series/%series/edit'. Added 
  series_access function.
by greenSkin: Added a wrapper function for the node series edit page callback to 
  use the series_edit_form and pass it the series object instead of the node 
  object.
by greenSkin: Set #theme on series_edit_form so series_node_edit_form utilizes 
  the same theme callback. Redirecting to series edit page now works when 
  creating new nodes in a series. Instead of using a submit function to perform 
  the redirection, we perform the operation in hook_nodeapi with ops insert and 
  update. The $form_state['values'] on submission of a newly created node has 
  not yet been given a nid so we couldn't redirect to the node's series edit 
  page, by using the hook_nodeapi we can.
