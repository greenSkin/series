Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-08-18
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Restructured the series array inside of $node->content. Title is
  now found in $node->content['series']['information'].


Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-08-12
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Added check on access to view a previous or next node before
  providing the link output. Added a series information output that shows the
  numbered position of the currently viewed node out of the total number in the
  series.


Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-08-04
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Updated series_nodes default to add attachment display showing
  the description of the series (term).
by greenSkin: Updated README.txt to better explain the module.
by greenSkin: Implemented our own form of taxonomy_select_nodes in order to
  grab all nodes tied to the series, not just the ones that are published.
by designerbrent: Added Series title, link and edit link to the information
  fieldset.
by greenSkin: When looking for the term data based on a string, don't settle
  for the first term, loop through the terms returned looking for the one
  associated to the series vocabulary. The query for selecting a series nodes
  now LEFT JOINs {series_weight} rather than INNER JOIN.
by greenSkin: Better use of views_access for our defined views pages.
by greenSkin: Updated views defaults to not specify a vocabulary and to use the
  full pager by default.
by designerbrent: Adding theme functions to the series navigation files.


Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-08-03
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Admin can now edit the series description (term description) via
  the series edit page.
by greenSkin: Renamed page title callback functions to reflect the view they go
  with. Added series_nodes page title callback function that sets the page
  title according to the series name.
by greenSkin: Removed views template file for series_nodes.


Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-08-02
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Now hard-setting the view page 'series/%'.
by greenSkin: Added menu item to 'series' view page.
by greenSkin: Added default theme template file for series view.
by greenSkin: Updated views defaults: removed the page displays in favor of
  hardcoding them within the module.
by greenSkin: Reverted comments in views-view-fields--series.tpl.php to the
  original default comments.
by greenSkin: Added default theme template file for series_nodes view.
by greenSkin: Renamed view series to series_list so as not to conflict with the
  series tag.
by greenSkin: Added nid field to series_nodes view and hid the title field.
  Updated the default views.
by greenSkin: Fixed page 'series' to use series_list view. Added title callback
  as well.
by greenSkin: Finished series block that lists other nodes in the active
  series.
by greenSkin: Added a weight of 1 to $node->content['series_navigation'] so it
  falls below the node body which defaults to a weight of 0.


Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-07-29
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Set a default weight to nodes in a series when they are first
  added to that series. Clean out the weight for a node in a series when it is
  no longer tied to that series. Clear the caches for series a node was
  formerly tied to and newly tied to.
by greenSkin: Instead of giving a default weight of 0 to nodes newly added to a
  series, we give a weight that equals the count of nodes already in the
  series. This ensures the node initially is added to the end of the series
  since weights start at -10 (gives a buffer of 10).
by greenSkin: Initial implementation of hook_block() to show series navigation.
by greenSkin: Initial work begun on embedding views to 'series/%'.


Series 6.x-x.x, 2010-07-28
--------------------------
by greenSkin: Fixed 'Add another' button to validate and redirect correctly
  when only one content type is used for the series vocabulary.
by greenSkin: Added series edit menu item '/series/%series/edit'. Added
  series_access function.
by greenSkin: Added a wrapper function for the node series edit page callback
  to use the series_edit_form and pass it the series object instead of the node
  object.
by greenSkin: Set #theme on series_edit_form so series_node_edit_form utilizes
  the same theme callback. Redirecting to series edit page now works when
  creating new nodes in a series. Instead of using a submit function to perform
  the redirection, we perform the operation in hook_nodeapi with ops insert and
  update. The $form_state['values'] on submission of a newly created node has
  not yet been given a nid so we couldn't redirect to the node's series edit
  page, by using the hook_nodeapi we can.
by greenSkin: Added Views default for series page, lists the available series'.
by greenSkin: Added default view for listing nodes in a series.
by greenSkin: Exposed {series_weight}.weight to Views. Added
  series_handler_filter_series_node_weight handler.
by greenSkin: Updated series_nodes default to incorporate the weight sort and
  filter.
